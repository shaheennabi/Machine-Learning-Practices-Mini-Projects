# Machine Learning Practices and Mini-Projects
### This repository will contain code and experiments related to various machine learning practices, including:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
* Feature Engineering
  
* Model Training and Testing
  
* Mini-Projects: Small-scale machine learning projects with a focus on practical implementation and experimentation.
  
* MLOps Experiments: Testing workflows and pipelines related to machine learning operations, model deployment, and monitoring.
  

  I will be continuously updating this repository with new notebooks and projects as I explore and experiment with different aspects of machine learning.
